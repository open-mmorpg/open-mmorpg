"""Checks a built .unitypackage before it reaches anyone.

Guards the things that would embarrass us in Asset Store review or quietly break
someone's project:

  * every entry lands under Assets/OpenMMORPG, so an import cannot scatter files
  * build tooling and CI config never ship to customers
  * the licence and third-party notices are present, as review requires
  * the project settings and the menu item that imports them travel with the kit,
    since Asset Store users have no installer package
  * the Package Manager manifest is embedded, including URP, which the kit needs

usage: check_package.py <archive.unitypackage>
